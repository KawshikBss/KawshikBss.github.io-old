My key skills include ReactJS, React Native, NextJS, ExpressJS, NodeJS, and Git, and I have a strong understanding of API and SOLID programming concepts. I am committed to lifelong learning and keeping up with the latest trends in technology. I approach every project with a can-do attitude and firmly believe that if it was developed by someone else, it can be developed again - and if it was never tried, I'm willing to take on the challenge.",
